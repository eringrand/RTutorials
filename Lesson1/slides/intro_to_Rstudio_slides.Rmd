### Top Left
You've been typing your code in an R script.

>- Anytime you're using R you should be writing code in script form!
>- You can save and share the code!
>- There are a few other ways to write R scripts, that may be useful in the future. \n (Such as Rmarkdown, R notebooks, or making slides.)


***
### Top Right
>- The variables that you name, show up in the *Environment* section on the RIGHT.
Try clicking on one of the variables with a BLUE ARROW. What did you see? 

>- You can also look at your *History* if you've lost a command or variable that you want back. It's searchable to make finding that missing command super easy!

***

### Bottom Right
1. **Working Directory:** Files in the working directory, you can change your working directory to anything else in the code or by going to that location and clicking *More -> Set as Directory*.
1. **Plots:** Any plots that you produce be in the "Plots" tab. It will keep a history so you can see changes as you make them.
1. **Packages:** You can download new packages by clicking *Packages -> Install*. You can load packages by checking them off, but this is best done in your scripts!
1. **Help:** Have a question on syntax of a command? You can look at it's help page by searching for it. You can also poke around tutorials and FAQ.


# Tips and Tricks
## Some Tips and Tricks
>- **Use tab complete:** Press "tab" after typing the first few letters to find the function, variable, or file that you need without having to type it all in.
>- **Highlight Strings:** You can highlight what you want to put quotes around at once.
>- **Short Cuts:** Hightlight what you want to run and press CNT-ENTER to run it.
      * Alt-Shit-K will bring up all the possible shortcuts. Once you get the hang of them, you can start creating your own.
