# Welcome and Introduction


## Before we jump into it, make sure that you have Rstudio, R and the package "Tidyverse" installed.

All, set? Great let's begin!

*** 

### Which language do people use for what?
```{r, echo=F}
kable(data.frame("What do you want to do?" = c(
  "Building a website",
  "Web application",
  "Phone Application",
  "Numerical Computation",
  "Stats",
  "Visualization",
  "Typesetting",
  "Big Data"),
Language = c(
  "HTML, CSS",
  "Java Script",
  "Swift, Objective C, Java",
  "IDL, Python, Matlab",
  "R, Strata",
  "R, JavaScript (D3)",
  "LaTeX, Mardown",
  "SQL, Scala, Python")
), align = "lc")
```


# why R?

***
### What problems have you seen or come across in the way you currently do data analyses and manipulation that you wish you could change?

Discuss with team.


## Why R?
**"Struggling through programming helps you learn" - Chester Ismay**

- **Free:** R and Rstudio are free and open sourced!
- **Reproducible:** Analyses done using R are easy to run again with updated data.
- **Collaboration:** Results are easy to share as a PDF.
- **Manipulation:** Data manipulation is much easier due to cool packages.
- **Understandable:** You can follow how new variables are created in someone else's code and to remember what past-you did.

## Why R?

- **Spot Checking:** You can also QC yourself along the way, instead of all at the end. PLUS code is often easier to QC because it'll yell at you when something goes wrong.
- **Visualizations:** Play with visualizations before throwing into a dashboard to see if it looks interesting.
- **Help:** Finding answers to your programming questions is a quick google away.
- **Ease:** You can create multiple data tables (files) in R  to be read into -tableau OR you can join them together in R and only have tableau read in one file.
- **Community:** Actively developed and a very active user community



# R History

## What is R?  

R is calculator
```
2 + 2
```

## NO!! 

R is a programming language.  Specifically it's a programming language built for statistics.  
And that's what it's best at.

</div>

---  

* R is a dialect of the S language which was developed by John Chambers at Bell Labs in 1976 and still exists today although hasn't changed much since 1998.  
* The philosophy behind S (and R) was to allow users to begin in an interactive environment that didn't explicitly feel like programming.
* As their needs and skills grew they could move into more of the programming aspects.  This helps us understand some of why R is the way it is.


# Packages

----  

* Packages are simply bits of code, external to the core R code that are designed to perform a specific function.  
* The vast majority of the usefulness and functionality of R resides in packages.  
* These packages live in online repositories and can be installed on your own system to be used.  

----  

## Installing packages

* Packages need only be installed once, although you may have to re-install when upgrading R or when you want to use a newer version of a package.
* To install from CRAN all one needs to do is:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Using packages

<small>
Once installed all the functions in a package are available to be used.
</small>

```{r, eval=F, evcho=T}
library(tidyverse)
filter(iris, Species == "setosa")
```

* <small> `library()` loads the package into memory and allows you to use the functions within without naming the package directly every time. </small>
* <small>  Technically what is happening here is that when attaching a package R puts those functions in your search path, the place R looks first for objects and functions. </small>
* <small> This may cause problems if packages have functions with the same name. R will choose the version for the package loaded last. </small>
* <small> Packages are attached in your current session and need to be attached every time you start a new session. </small>

# Data Types

## Data Types
Data type | Example
------------- | -------------
Integer | `1`
Logical | `TRUE`
Numeric | `1.1`
String / character  | `"Red"`
Factor (enumerated string) | `"Amber"` or 2 in `c("Red","Amber","Green")`
Complex | `i`
Date | `r as.Date("2015-04-24")`
NA | `r NA`

## Data Functions
Function | Use
------------- | -------------
`is.[data type]` | Whether a vector is of a particular type
`as.[data type]` | Attempts to coerce a vector to a data type
`str` | Structure of an object including class/data type, dimensions 
`class` | The class(es)/data type(s) an object belongs to
`summary` | Summarizes an object 
`dput` | Get R code that recreates an object
`unlist` | Simplify a list to a vector
`dim` | Dimensions of a data type
`length` | Length of a vector or list

## Compound data types
Data type | Info | Construction example(s)
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Vector | A 1D set of values of the same data type | `c(1,"a")` , `1:3`
List | A collection of objects of various data types | `list(vector=c(1,"a")`, `df=data.frame(a=1:6))`
Data.frame  | A 2D set of values of different data types | `data.frame(a=1:26, b=11:36)`

# Other important key R functions 

## Generating and manipulating sequences

---- 

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
seq(1,10)

seq(1, 20, by = 2)

seq(from = 2, by = 2.5, length.out = 10)
```


```{r, collapse=TRUE}
rep(2, 3)

rep(1:3, 4)

rep(1:3, each = 2)

rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 6)

```



## Basic statistics

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
set.seed(3823)
x <- sample(1:1000, size = 50, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
max(x)

min(x)

range(x)

mean(x)

median(x)

sum(x)

sd(x)

var(x)
```

---- 

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
sum(if_else(x > 400, 1, 0))
```
<div align="right">
![](https://github.com/eringrand/RTutorials/blob/gh-pages/Lesson1/images/dancing_penguin.gif?raw=true)
</div>

---

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
y <- rnorm(x, 1, 0.2 * x) + x
plot(x,y)
```

---- 

### Simple linear model

```{r}
my_model <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(my_model)
```

----

```{r}
plot(x, y, main = "Linear model")
abline(my_model, col = "red")
```
 
# Assignment and Subsetting

## Variables are asigned with `<-`

```{r, collapse=T}
x <- 5 
x <- c(1, 3, 4, 5)
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 2:6) 
```

<small>Shortcut: Alt + - </small>

## Columns in a Dataframe can be accesed or created with `$`

```{r, collapse=T}
df$z <- df$x + df$y
```

Though if you need to create more than one new column, it's much more concise to use `mutate()`.

## Accessing elements
![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CO2_qPVWsAAErbv.png)

<small>From [\@hadleywickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)</small>

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
x <- 1:5
x[3]
x[3] <- 42
x
```

---

## Different Ways to Subset Vectors

Subset Type | Example | Example Output
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Nothing | `x[]` | `r x[] `
Positive integers | `x[5]` | `r x[5]`
Negative integers | `x[-1]` | `r x[-1]`
Logical vectors | `x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]` | `r x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]`
Zero | `x[0]` | `r x[0]`

---

## Subsetting Data frames

* `$` + column name to create or access a column
* `df[row, column]`

*Note that a much more detailed overview of subsetting can be found in the [Subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html) chapter of Advanced R.*

# Where to get help

## Built-in help

R-package authors are required to document their functions although this happens at a various levels of usefulness.  

* Simply type `?function_name` to get help on a function. 
* Look carefully what parameters the function requires and what type they are.  
* Some are required (listed first, no default) and some are optional (a default value is usually listed).  
* Most function help will also indicate what the function returns.  
* Good documentation also has more information on what the function is doing.


## Elsewhere

* Sometimes authors will provide more detailed documentation online.  
* This is more common for more recent packages where the authors may have a github repository and associated webpage.  
* Often discussion pages (Google groups, Stack overflow) can also be a useful source of help

# Errors

## __GOOGLE IT!!!__

If I get an error I haven't seen, the first thing I will do is Google it. Usually within a few clicks I can find what went wrong.

![](http://media1.giphy.com/media/cp9mafwcwRCkU/giphy-downsized.gif)  

---- 

**But sometimes an easy answer can't be found so here's a quick process to walk through:**

1.  Re-read the error and then think about it for a minute.  See if you can't get a grasp on what's really going wrong.
2.  Check your code for errors.  Spelling errors, misplaced commas, forgotten parenthesis can all cause problems
3.  Look it up - I very, very rarely get an error that someone else hasn't seen before.
4.  If you still can't find a solution then you can ask for help. I can answer brief questions or you can post questions online at Stack Overflow.  

---- 

To get you started here are few of the more common errors you might see:

*Think about what is going wrong for each of these.*

----

```{r, error=TRUE}
my_object
```
  
----  
```{r, error=TRUE}
iris[, 6]
```
- Hint: How many columns does the `iris` data frame have?

----

```{r, error=TRUE}
a < - 5
```
- Hint: look carefully

---- 
```{r, error=TRUE}
sample[1:10,]
```

- Hint:  What does `typeof(sample)` give you? What about `sample(10)`?  Or `?sample`


---- 
```{r, error=TRUE}
pet_a_cat()
```


----
```{r, error=TRUE}
nothing = NA
if (nothing == NA) {
	print("empty")
}
```

- Hint:  What does `nothing == NA` give you?  How about `is.na(nothing)`?

---- 
```{r, error=TRUE}
my_data <- read.table("mydata.txt")
```

- Hint: Read the error message carefully.

----
```{r, error=TRUE}
x <- data.frame(y = NULL)
x$y = 1:4
```

- Hint: How many rows does `x` have?

----
```{r}
mean(c(NA, 4, 2))
```
- Hint: Is this an error?

# Questions so Far

# Scripting

## What are the important parts of a program?
- Set working directory
- Load packages
- Load data
- Functions
- Code!


## How do you write fast, good, clean code?
- Comment comment comment
- Use tabs and spaces to the best of your ability
- THINK VERY HARD ABOUT EVERY FOR LOOP YOU USE. Do you really need it? (We'll talk about this more in a bit.)
- If you're using the same chunk of code  over and over again, write it into a function.


# Sample Script...

## Sample Script...

```{r, eval=F, echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, list(width.cutoff=50), tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=50)}
# Set working directory
setwd("S:/Data Analytics/State Test Analysis/2015-2016/New York State Exams/Results Release/Tableau Data Files/")

# Load packages
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Define Functions
# file = file name, sheetname = sheet number or name, cn = T or F
loaddata <- function(file, sheetname, cn){
  x <- read_excel(file, sheet = sheetname, na = "", col_names = cn)
  valid_names <- make.names(names=names(x), unique=TRUE, allow_ = TRUE)
  names(x) <- valid_names
  return(x)
}

# Load Data
statetestNYS <- loaddata("Uncommon Student Level Results 15-16.xlsx", "Student Scores", T)

# Look at historical state test profiency by school for ELA and Math in schools
plotdat <- statetestNYS %>% 
  filter(Subject != "Science", 
         Region == "NY",
         !(Grade == 8 & Subject == "Math")
         ) %>%
  mutate(prof = ifelse(Standard.Achieved %in% c("Level 3", "Level 4"), 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(Year, Uncommon.school.abbreviation, Subject, Grade) %>% 
  summarise(avgP = mean(prof))

ggplot(plotdat, aes(Year, avgP, color=Subject)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(Subject~Grade)
```
