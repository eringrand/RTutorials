# Introduction to R: Data Manipulation
Focusing on packages found in tidyverse


## Packages
Download tidyverse:
Imports: dplyr, ggplot2, lubricate, readr, readxl, stringr, tibble, tidyr, magrittr
if you're using multiple packages make sure you're loading them in the right order
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Tidy Data
<div class="centerd">
![](https://github.com/eringrand/RTutorials/blob/master/Lesson1/images/tidy-1.jpg?raw=true)
</class>

1. Each variable forms a column
1. Each observation forms a row
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table

## Learn to think in Code
How to do you currently think about a task in excel or tableau? Learn how to translate and use that process in code. If you can relate it to how you already think you'll find it easier to transition between the two. 

1. What is your process for creating a pivot table?
1. What is your process for creating a new column?
1. How do you sort data?


## SPLIT APPLY COMBINE
1.	Split up the original data (this can be any format including data frames, lists, arrays, matrices, vectors),
2.	Apply existing or custom functions to it, and
3.	Combine the results in the same or different format.

This will come back in a later lesson when we look at `PURR` and functional programing.



# DPLYR

##  Five Most Important DPLYR Functions
1.	`Filter`
2.	`Select`
3.	`Arrange`
4.	`Mutate`
5.	`Group_by`, `Summarize` (`Summarise`)


## Filter
Task: filter the IA data to only include NY 8th grade students Math tests. This way you'll only looking at Regents test takers.


## Select
Task:

## Arrange
Task:

## Mutate
Task:

## Group by and Summarize


# Joins

## Which Join is which?
<!-- ![]() -->

## Left-Join vs Inner-Join vs Full-Join


## Advantages of Anti-Join


## What about Right-Join?
- There aren't many use cases for right joining data, HOWEVER if you are piping a set of set which creates your map and you want to join it back to the orginal data, to continue the pipe you would use a right join.
