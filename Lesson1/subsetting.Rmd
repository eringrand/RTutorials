# Basic Subsetting

----

There are 6 different ways to subset and 3 subsetting operators. 


## Vectors

1. Positive integers 

2. Negative integers

3. Logical vectors 

4. Nothing 

5. Zero returns a zero length vector

6. Character vector

## Lists

Lists work in the same way as vectors.  We'll look at how the different subsetting operators `[`, `[[`, and `$` change what you pull out of the list.

## Matrices

Matrices have two dimensions, each one is subset like a one-dimensional vector. Rows are first, then columns.

Matrices can be indexed with a single vector and in this case the matrix will behave like a vector.


## Data frames

Data frames can be indexed with a single vector like list (remember data frame columns are like a list).  They can (and are more commonly) indexed with two vectors like a matrix.

## Subsetting operators

* You can also `[[` and `$` to subset.  
* The difference is the type of object they return.  
* `[[` is most useful for lists because `[` always returns a list and not the actual value.  
* However, `[[` only returns a single value so it can only be used with a single positive integer or a string.

The different operators are useful in different situations and you often find yourself using multiple operators in a single subsetting operation

Read the chapter on Subsetting from Advanced R for more details.  In particular the section on simplifying versus preserving will save you many headaches in the future.
