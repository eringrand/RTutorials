This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button (green arrow) within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```


I'm going to start you off with loading `tidyverse` into your Notebook. Huzzah!
```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

I will load uncommon data for assignments. This code block will take awhile to run, so be patient.

```{r, collapse=T}
IAs <- readRDS("S:/Data Analytics/Resource Library/R Help/data/IAs.rds")
assessMap <- readRDS("S:/Data Analytics/Resource Library/R Help/data/assessMap.rds")
schoolMap <- readRDS("S:/Data Analytics/Resource Library/R Help/data/schoolMap.rds")
thisyearEnrollment <- readRDS("S:/Data Analytics/Resource Library/R Help/data/thisyearEnrollment.rds")

str(thisyearEnrollment)
str(IAs)
#str(assessMap)
```


# Intro
This is your file now, feel free to take notes and try out code as you wish. Yay notes! Yay you!

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

## Getting Around RStudio

### Discussion Questions:
1. Describe the difference between a R script and a R notebook? 


## R basics

### Discussion Questions:

1. What problems have you come across in your normal data analysis that you wish to change?

2. What **reason** behind using R stands out to you the most? (I.E. What's going to be your "carrot" to keep going?)

### Exercises:

1. Does order you load packages matter? What might you do if you need a function that's named the same in two different packages?
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# answer here, you don't need to complete the functions
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
select()
MASS::select()
```

2. Can I combine data types in one vector? Try the code and see what happens. 
```{r}
c(1, 4, FALSE, "Erin")
```

3. Explain this:
```{r collapse=T}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1/49 * 49 == 1
```



### Assignment from the basic R slides:
**Using the comma_survey dataset in the fivethirtyeight dataset...**

1. How do you load the _fivethirtyeight_ package to find the *comma_survey* data set?
1. What is the income, education and location of the respondent in the 42nd row?
1. How many respondents are in this data set? How many locations?
1. How many respondents care about the oxford comma **A lot**? 
1. What is the average *care rate* of the singular vs plural form of "data"? 
1. How many **Male** respondents in the age range of **45-60** think that care about proper grammar is **Very important**?

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
df <- fivethirtyeight::comma_survey
mean(ifelse(df$care_data == "A lot", 1, 0), na.rm=T)

x <- filter(df, 
       gender == "Male", 
       age == "45-60",
       care_proper_grammar == "Very important")
length(x)
```

```{r}
# Write your answers here.

```


## Data Transformation
### Discussion Questions:

1. What is your process for creating a pivot table?

2. When do you think you should you use `mutate()` vs creating a new column with `df$x`?

3. What would be a use case to have a `group_by()` WITHOUT `summarize()`?

### Exercises: 

1. Filter the IA data to include only students who will be taking the 8th Grade Regents exam.

```{r}
IAsDF <- IAs %>% 
  left_join(assessMap, by=c("Assessment"="Assessment.Name", "Grade")) 

#IAsDF %>% filter(__Fill this in___) 
```

2.  The IA data has SO MANY columns which aren't really useful if we only want the passing rate of these students. Find the ones we need and select only them.

```{r}

```

3. Create a column called `Pass` that describes if the student is predicted to pass the exam (1) or not (0).
```{r}

```

### Examples:

```{r, eval=T}
library(fivethirtyeight)
avengers <- mutate(fivethirtyeight::avengers, 
       death1 = ifelse(!is.na(death1)& death1, 1, 0 ),
       death2 = ifelse(!is.na(death2)& death2, 1, 0 ),
       death3 = ifelse(!is.na(death3)& death3, 1, 0 ),
       death4 = ifelse(!is.na(death4)& death4, 1, 0 ),
       death5 = ifelse(!is.na(death5)& death5, 1, 0 ),
       total.deaths = death1 + death2 + death3 + death4 + death5) 
```

## The Pipe
### Exercises: 

1. Tell a story with pipes! 
```
char1 %>%
  does_a_thing()
```

### Discussion Questions:

1. When should you use the pipe vs not?


2. Beside ease of writing/reading what is useful about using the pipe structure?


3. What should you never do in a pipe group?
