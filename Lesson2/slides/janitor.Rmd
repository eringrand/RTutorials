From the description file: 

Janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced users can already do everything covered here, but they can do it faster with janitor and save their thinking for more fun tasks.

---

The janitor functions expedite the initial data exploration and cleaning that comes with any new data set. This catalog describes the usage for each function.

---

You should be able to do everything inside janitor on your own, but we don't have the time to always clean up data without help.

Benefits to using Janitor over writing your own code:

- Functions are well tested
- Data obeys Hadley's official style guide
- Generally turn many lines of code into one or two (huzzah!)
- Pipe-able
- Written for the education data space

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library("janitor")
library("readxl")
library("dplyr")
```


Two main functions I use all the time:

- `clean_names()`
- `get_dupes()`

Other really usual functions:

- `remove_empty_rows()` 
- `remove_empty_cols()`
- `excel_numeric_to_date()`


## Example 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
filepath <- "S:/Data Analytics/State Test Analysis/2016-2017/Uncommon Roster Prep/~Data/Source/Uncommon Roster 2016-17.xlsx"
read_excel(filepath, sheet="Sheet1", col_types = "text") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  remove_empty_cols() %>%
  remove_empty_rows() %>%
  mutate_at(vars(entrydate, exitdate, student_id, yearsinuncommon), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(entrydate, exitdate), excel_numeric_to_date) %>%
  head()
```


---

Even more functions

- `tabyl()`
- `adorn_totals("row")`
- `crosstab()`
- `adorn_crosstab()`
