## Tidy Data
![Hadley](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png)

### The essence of tidy data is:
  
1. Each variable forms a column
1. Each observation forms a row
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table

---

### Why?

- Standardized
- Easier for you and others to analyze
- Easier for the computer to analyze
- Easier to go from Tidy format into other formats if needed

---

Example: Is this untidy or tidy data?

```{r, collapse=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
str(fivethirtyeight::bob_ross)
```

---

Is this tidy data?
```{r, collapse=T, echo=FALSE}
dplyr::starwars %>% head()
```




# Cleaning and restructuring data


## Step 1:  Make sure it imported correctly  

- Are your column types correct?
- Are all the columns and rows there?
- How about your headers (if you have them)?
- Did R give you any warnings?
- Look at your data!


## Step 2:  Tidy it up

- Think about how you want your data structured for analysis
- What are your observations?  What are your variables?  Do you need multiple tables to capture your data better?
- Use `tidyr::gather()` and `tidyr::spread()` to appropriately transform your data
- If you have super messy data with lots of code needed to clean it up, save the cleaned data separately for the final analysis output.

# Gather and Spread

---
        
tidyr |	`gather`|	`spread`
------|-------|---------
reshape2	|`melt`	| `cast`
spreadsheets |	unpivot	| pivot
databases	| fold	| unfold

---


## Gather
- moves data into long form
- syntax is similar to `select`
- `gather(key, value, ...)`

## Example

```{r, warning=FALSE}
gather(fivethirtyeight::bob_ross, object, included, apple_frame:wood_framed) %>%
  arrange(episode, season, episode_num, title) 
```


## Spread
- moves data into long form
- you can only easily spread one column at a time
- if values for groups are missing, there are filled in with NA by default
- you can change the fill parameter in the spread call to fill in missing results with something else
`spread(key, value, fill=0)`
- sometimes you don't have a value column to spread out, but you can always make one with `mutate`

## Example
2015-16 New York State Exams

```{r}
read_rds("S:/Data Analytics/State Test Analysis/2016-2017/New York State Exams/Results Release/~Data/Processed/Uncommon Student-level results/Output/NYS_SY1516_results.rds") %>% 
  filter(grade != 13) %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  group_by(school, school_type, region, assessment_description) %>%
  summarise(percent_proficient = mean(proficient)) %>%
  spread(assessment_description, percent_proficient) 
```




# Unite and Seperate

## Unite is a concatenate function.

>- You define the name of the new column, and the ones you want to combine, in the order you wish to do so

```{r, eval=FALSE}
unite(temp, school, grade)
```

Creates columns called "temp" from school and grade. 
 
>- You can also set the separator value with sep=" ", the default is "snake case" i.e sep="_"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
unite(temp, school, grade, sep="")
```


## Separate
The opposite of unite!
- separates values in a single column into new columns
- Works best when every value in the column has the same number of possible elements to separate
- If not, fill parameter 
- Define what the split is with sep="_". The default value is any non-alpha-numeric values (.,_...etc)

## Example: Spead two columns
Subject, Raw Score, Scaled Score -> ELA Raw Score, ELA Scaled Score, Math Raw Score, Math Scaled Score

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
(df <- tibble(student = c("bob", "bob"), subject = c("ELA", "Math"), scaled_score = c(100, 200), raw_score = c(20, 50)))
```

---
```{r}
df %>% unite(temp, raw_score, scaled_score) %>%
  spread(subject, temp) %>%
  separate(ELA, c("ela_raw_score", "ela_scaled_score")) %>%
  separate(Math, c("math_raw_score", "math_scaled_score")) 
```

---

# You try

## Task 1:
Using the AP Input student scores, create a table which shows how many student received each level per grade and school. We want a column for each level and a total.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_excel("S:/Data Analytics/HS Results Deck/2016-17/AP/Data Processing/AP Input.xlsx", 2, col_types="text") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(score = paste0("l", score)) %>%
  count(year, school, grade, subject, score) %>%
  spread(score, n, fill=0) %>%
  mutate(total = l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 + l5) %>%
  head()
```
