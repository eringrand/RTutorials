# Writing Functions

## What is a function?
What would your definition be?

## Why and when should you write your own functions?

- Do not repeat yourself: Never copy paste more than twice if you can, instead write out your process in a function.
- Another advantage of functions is that if our requirements change, we only need to make the change in one place. 



---

There are three key steps to creating a new function:

1. You need to pick a name for the function. It is recommended to use a _verd_ as a name. I.e `read_ny_data`, even though it's a bit long - it's readable.

2. You list the inputs, or arguments, to the function inside function. A function with one argument may look like `function(x)` whereas one with multiple looks like `function(x, y, z)`.

3. You place the code you have developed in body of the function, a { block that immediately follows function(...). We'll see an example in a second.

---





## Simple Function

```
add <- function(x) {
  sum(x)
}

```

```
best_pets <- function(animal){
  if(animal == "Cats") {
      print("Cats are better than dogs.")
    }
  else if(animal == "Dogs") {
      print("Dogs are better than cats")
    }
  else{
    print("You must choose: Cats or Dogs")
  }
}
```

## Structure
- `function(args)`: let R know that are you writing a function and not to directly implement this section of code till you call it
- `{}` the _code_ of your function should be between {'s
- `foo <- function(args){}`: name your function with the assignment operator
  - Reminder: name your function in the VERB sense of what you're function is accomplishing
  - i.e: `clean_data()`, `read_data()`, `input_cohort()`, ...etc


## Real world example
```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_file <- function(file, sheet_name=1){
  read_excel(file, sheet = sheet_name, col_names = TRUE, col_types = "text") %>%
    remove_empty_cols() %>%
    remove_empty_rows() %>%
    clean_names()
}

read_file("~/data.xlsx")
```

## Why is this so useful?
Discuss!


## Assignments within Functions

- The body of the function is normal R code... however it is not executed outside the function
  - i.e `x <- 1` in a a function does not change the value of x outside the function
- The last thing created in a function is automatically returned, so you do not have to use `return(x)`

---
```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_file <- function(file, sheet_name=1){
  read_excel(file, sheet = sheet_name, col_names = TRUE, col_types = "text") %>%
    remove_empty_cols() %>%
    remove_empty_rows() %>%
    clean_names()
}

read_file("~/data.xlsx")
```
---

## Arugments
- Name the arguments something that makes sense to use throughout the function
- Include as many arguments as you need
- If you are passing the data frame into the function, it should be the first argument
- Example: Here our arguments are the file location and a sheet number or name.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_file <- function(file, sheet_name=1){
  read_excel(file, sheet = sheet_name, col_names = TRUE, col_types = "text") %>%
    remove_empty_cols() %>%
    remove_empty_rows() %>%
    clean_names()
}

read_file("~/data.xlsx")
```

## Discussion Questions
- Why did I set sheet_name to be sheet_name=1? What does this allow for in my function?
- What can't I do with functions? Or at least, what's super hard and annoying? (Hint. Think dplyr.)
- Where should you house common functions you may need all the time?

# Using Custom Functions in DPLYR


## Example student roster

```{r, echo=FALSE}
students <- tibble::tribble(
  ~student_id, ~grade, ~school_year, ~es_grad, ~backfilled,
   4641219404,     09,    "2016-17",  NA,        1,
   5677497066,     07,    "2015-16",  1,         0,
   4410073751,     04,    "2016-17",  NA,        0,
   5165383282,     06,    "2016-17",  1,         0,
   7414861057,     03,    "2016-17",  NA,        1,
   8899701876,     10,    "2016-17",  NA,        0,
   5814766659,     05,    "2015-16",  NA,        1,
   4523939000,     04,    "2015-16",  NA,        1,
   2852910440,     09,    "2015-16",  1,         NA,
   4237200058,     06,    "2016-17",  1,         0,
   6288262677,     04,    "2015-16",  NA,        NA,
   1511873670,     03,    "2015-16",  NA,        0
  )

```


## Example with `mutate`

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
include_cohort <- function(grade, school_year) {
  years_to_grad <- 12 - as.numeric(grade) # add the as.numeric() due to possibility of leading 0s
  year <- stringr::str_sub(school_year, -2, -1) %>% paste0("20", .) %>% as.numeric()
  cohort <- year + years_to_grad
}

students %>%
  mutate(cohort = include_cohort(grade, school_year)) %>% # run through all the students
  head()
```

## You try
Create a function that will change all the NAs in es_grad to 0.

- What are you going to name your function?
- What arguments do you need to pass in?
- Are there other columns that may need to be worked on the same way?
- Extra credit: Use a function to change all the 1's to YES and the 0's to NO in both es_grad and backfilled


## Example with `mutate_at`
```{r}
ignore_nas <- function(x){
  ifelse(is.na(x), 0, x)
}

class_yes_no <- function(x){
  x <- ignore_nas(x)
  ifelse(x == 1, "YES", "NO")
}

students %>% mutate_at(vars(es_grad, backfilled), class_yes_no)
```

# Using Custom Functions with PURRR

---
- What is functional programming?
- What is iteration?
- How do you combine functions with iteration?
- Why would you do this?
---

We're going to touch the VERY BASICS of the `purrr` package. It can be challenging to understand and use, but in most cases, you will have a single use case for these functions and will get the hang of it quickly.

---


## `purrr::map_x`

Map_x functions:

- `map_df`: outputs a data frame, usually by sticking multiple inputs together **THIS IS THE ONE YOU WILL USE**
- `map_chr`: outputs a character
- `map_int`: outputs an integer
- `map`: outputs a list **Do not use this without Erin's help**

---

Three ways to call map:

---

### One Line:
Input 1: list or column vector of inputs
Input 2: function name
Input 3+: other arguments for the the function

```
map_df(filepaths, read_excel, col_names=T)

```

---

### Custom function with one input

Input 1: list or column vector of inputs
Input 2: function name

```
combine_new_data <- function(file){
  read_excel(file)
}

map_df(filepaths, combine_ny_data)

```
---

### Write the function in map

Input 1: list or column vector of inputs
Input 2: code, beginning with `~` and include `.x` for the inputs

_Note: strspilt is pretty annoying, but can be really useful for strings_

```{r}
# example: you have text such as UCHS_ELA09 and you want just UCHS
schools <- c("UCHS_ELA09", "UCC_ALG02")
map_chr(schools, ~strsplit(.x, "_")[[1]][1])
```
## Comments
- ALWAYS try your function on ONE thing first before using map.




# You Try

---
### Task: Read in many files of the same format to one data frame.
- You're going to be using the NY prior year scores:
  `Non-Uncommon Prior Year Results\~Data\Source\NYC`
- Get the list of files into R (hint: `?list.files`) 
- Write a function that will read in a file and clean it. 
    - only include grade 3-8 students
    - only include season == "SP16" where `ss` (scaled score) is given
- Use `map_df` to read in ALL the files into one data frame
- Extra credit: There are lots of duplicates! Try and get rid of them.
